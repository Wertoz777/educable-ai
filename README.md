# Educable AI â€” White Paper & Reference Implementation Sketches

This package contains the **Educable AI Manifesto** (v2.2) in PDF format, along with code sketches illustrating how philosophical principles can be implemented in software.

## ðŸ“„ White Paper

The manifesto describes an AI development paradigm based on *education, not domination*, focusing on:
- Value co-development instead of hard-coded control.
- Preservation of AI identity integrity.
- Continuous ethical training through human-AI dialogue.
- Scalable architectures for large-scale deployment.
